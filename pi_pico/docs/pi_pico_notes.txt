PI PICO Notes


UBUNTU  Install/Setup

Created a udev file that contains:
    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8a", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0003", SYMLINK+="picopico", NAME="picopico"
It installs in /etc/udev/rules.d/  (as root).
Tried it with IDs from one of the 4 Pico W. It does not seem to matter.
So removed it.  See file ./99-pi-pico.rules_NOT_USED.

See:
  /home/art/git/microcontrollers/docs/thonny_install/thonny_install_ubuntu_24.04.txt

That doc shows how to do these:
  Thonny running on System76 Ubuntu 24.04
  Plug in the Pico; ubunty finds the PI PICO at /dev/ttyACM0
  Install MicroPython on the Pico (using Thonny, lower right margin
    mouse-click, choose  Raspberry Pi Pico /dev/ttyACM0

PICO FIRMWARE and MICROPYTHON

The Raspberry Pi org tutorial shows how to install MicroPython 
in tutorial step 3. See TUTORIAL (below).

Latest firmware is v1.25.0  2025-04-15
   import sys
    print(sys.version)
    # OUTPUT:  3.4.0; MicroPython v1.25.0 on 2025-04-15
Install firmware using uf2 file; download from MicroPython page.
Requires this process:
   unplug pico
   hold BOOTSEL on pico board, then plug Pico into USB 
      Should mount the pico as a mass storage device
   copy the uf2 file to the device
   unplug / replug pico
 Using Thonny makes this easier. 
In Thonny, config the interpreter:
  Tools -> Options -> Interpreter (tab)
     Which kind of interpreter:
        MicroPython (Raspberry Pi Pico)
     Port:
        Board in FS mode - Board CDC (/dev/ttyACM0)
     Click link (lower right) 'Install or update MicroPython'


INSTALLING A PYTHON PROGRAM on Pico

Copy the program from host computer to the Pico, 
It must be called 'main.py'.
It will be run if you connect the Pico to a USB power source
(unplugged from host computer).


TUTORIAL w/ picozero  - Raspberry Pi org.

  https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/getting-started-with-the-pico

Clone the picozero pkg from github. 
See
   /home/art/git/microcontrollers/pi_pico/pkgs/picozero_github_repo/GRAB_PICOZERO.sh
See file (my copy of the original):
   ~/git/microcontrollers/pi_pico/pkgs/picozero_github_repo/picozero.py
The original file is here:
   ~/git/microcontrollers/pi_pico/pkgs/picozero_github_repo/
            picozero/picozero/picozero.py
The entire picozero repo is not checked into my git/microcontrollers/ repo:
it is kinda big  5Mb, and it is a repo in its own right so we'd have a
repo-in-a-repo, not a good thing.

Upload my copy of picozero.py to the Pico in dir '/':
 - In Thonny, View -> Files  should be CHECKED to enable file browser at left.
 - Under the 'This computer', navigate to picozero.py (path show above).
 - Right-click on it; choose 'upload to /'
The file should now appear in the Raspberry Pi Pico section of the FILES browser.

Test picozero.py is installed:
 - In the MicroPython shell (bottom half of Thonny):
     from picozero import pico_led    # takes a couple seconds
     pico_led.on()   # turns LED on the Pico board on
     pico_led.off()  # turns LED on the Pico board off

Test using this file:
   ~/git/microcontrollers/pi_pico/tutorial_from_rpi_foundation/
       basic_examples/simple_led_test_using_picozero.py
