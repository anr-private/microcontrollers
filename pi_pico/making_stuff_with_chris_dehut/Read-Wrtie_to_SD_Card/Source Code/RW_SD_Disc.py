#You will need an SD Card adapter / Breakout board with SPI interface - Link provided on our companion website
#Wire it up to your pico per the frizting diagram.
#Insert a FAT32 formatted SD Card into the slot and run the following program

# Assign chip select (CS) pin (and start it high)
cs = machine.Pin(9, machine.Pin.OUT)    #set pin GPIO 9 as output for use as Chip Select on SPI interface
cs.value(1)                             #set the pin to high 

# Intialize SPI peripheral (start with 1 MHz)
spi = machine.SPI(1,                           #Configure the SPI interface
