POWER

  LCD 1602 power:  1-2 mA for display. 30-40 mA if backlit; 100-120 mA possible.
      QAPASS actual (with backlight):  3.3v 46mA   5.0v 80mA

Pi Pico
  20-50 mA when using wifi, peaking 100mA. Common avg 45 mA. 18-20 mA at idle.

 VBUS  pin 40.  provides power direct from USB pin D1.
                Monitor using GPIO 24 (no physical pin).

 VSYS  pin 39. Main 'power in' feed.  1.8 - 5.5 V input. 
               Whend USB provides power, VSYS is the input volts from VBUS
               minus Schottky diode drop (usu. 5v - (0.15 to 0.45) or about 4.9v.
               This loss can be eliminated by shorting VSYS - VBUS but ONLY IF
               the power source is EXCLUSIVELY the USB / VBUS.
               If an external voltage is applied to VSYS, it should be through
               a Schottky diode to protect against backfeed of the USB.
               This allows having voltage applied to both VSYS and VBUS -
               the Pico has a diode to prevent backfeeding from VSYS,
               and the external supply's Schottky protects against
               backfeeding from VBUS into VSYS. Allows for redundant power.
               A better way is to use a MOSFET ahead of VSYS.
               See raspberrypi.com Pi Pico data sheet for details.
               Also shows how to power using a battery and its charger.
 3v3(OUT) pin 36. Can provide 300mA max. 

LCD POWER
 - Separate power source
   Powering an LCD from VBUS works but the LCD will run its I2C at 5 V, too
   high for the 3.3v expected by Pico's GPIO pins (its I2C). So should use
   a level shifter on the I2C pins.
 - Using Pico 3v3 (physical pin 36). QAPASS works ok, a bit dim. Draws 45mA.
