SEARCH: 'ubuntu 24.04 how to fix udev to mount pi pico'

Bus 001 Device 016: ID 2e8a:0003 Raspberry Pi RP2 Boot

To ensure the Raspberry Pi Pico mounts consistently in Ubuntu 24.04, you need to create or modify a udev rule. This rule will assign a specific device name to the Pico when it's plugged in and in BOOTSEL mode. This prevents it from being assigned a random name each time. 
Here's how to do it:
1. Create or Edit the udev Rule:

    Open a terminal and use a text editor (like nano) to create or edit a udev rule file. A common location for these files is /etc/udev/rules.d/. For example, you could create a file named 99-picotool.rules: 
 sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-picotool.rules


2. Add the Udev Rule:

    Add a rule that identifies the Pico and assigns it a specific device name. The following is an example, adjust the vendor and product IDs as needed: 


    SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="1234", ATTRS{idProduct}=="5678", SYMLINK+="picopico", NAME="picopico"

SUBSYSTEM=="usb": This indicates the rule applies to USB devices.
ATTRS{idVendor}=="1234": Replace 1234 with the actual vendor ID of your Pico.
ATTRS{idProduct}=="5678": Replace 5678 with the product ID of your Pico.
SYMLINK+="picopico": Creates a symbolic link named picopico to the device.
NAME="picopico": Assigns the device the name picopico.

3. Reload udev Rules:

    Save the file and reload the udev rules: 

    sudo udevadm control --reload-rules
    sudo udevadm trigger


4. Test the Rule:

    Plug the Pico into your computer in BOOTSEL mode. You can do this by pressing and holding the BOOTSEL button while connecting the USB cable.
    Verify that the Pico is recognized with the name you specified (in this case, picopico). You can check by looking at the output of lsblk or dmesg


5. Optional: Create a Boot Script (if needed):

    If you need to automate the mounting of the Pico, you can create a simple script that finds the device based on the udev rule and mounts it to a specific directory. 

SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2e8f", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0001", SYMLINK+="pico", NAME="pico"


Key Points:

    Vendor and Product IDs:
    You'll need to determine the correct vendor and product IDs for your Pico. You can find these by running lsusb and inspecting the output when the Pico is in BOOTSEL mode. 

Device Names:
Choose a descriptive name for the device that you can easily remember and use in scripts. 
Permissions:
Ensure that the user you're using has appropriate permissions to access the device. You may need to adjust the GROUP or MODE in the udev rule if necessary.
