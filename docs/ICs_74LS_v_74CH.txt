74HC vs 74LS: Key Differences

The 74HC series, based on CMOS technology, generally outperforms the 74LS series in terms of power consumption, noise immunity, and wider voltage compatibility, making it a preferred choice for various digital applications. The 74LS series, while faster, is somewhat more power-hungry and may be more susceptible to noise. The choice between the two depends on specific application requirements.

MIXING HC and LS:

  An HC chip needs >70% Vcc for the high voltage, which an LS gate is not guaranteed to deliver.
  Use a pullup resistor on the output of the LS. Its output is rated to sink 8mA, so you can go down as far as a 620ohm resistor, though a higher value will use less current in the low state. 1k is a reasonable value to try. You cannot go too high in value, otherwise the pullup speed into load capacitance will be too slow and still not fix your multiple clock transitions. You will need to experiment with this if you want to use less current.


74LS Series

74LS series is characterized by its TTL technology, 5-volt operation, fast switching speeds, and the use of Schottky transistors. It has been a reliable choice for digital logic applications and is still used in various scenarios, especially where compatibility with existing systems is a consideration.

    Bipolar-Transistor Based (TTL Technology)

The 74LS series is based on TTL (Transistor-Transistor Logic) technology. TTL uses bipolar junction transistors (BJTs) in its design. Each gate in the 74LS IC typically consists of several transistors, resistors, and diodes, providing a robust and well-established technology.

    5-Volt Operation

The 74LS series operates on a 5-volt power supply. This voltage level is common in many digital systems, especially those designed around the TTL logic family.

    15nS Switching Speed

The 74LS series is known for its relatively fast switching speeds, typically around 15 nanoseconds (15nS). This speed makes it suitable for a variety of digital applications where rapid signal processing is required.

    8mA Sink Capacity

The 74LS series has a sink capacity of 8mA. This refers to its ability to sink current (provide a low output) when connected to a load. It indicates the maximum current that can be drawn from an output without causing a significant voltage drop.

    Transistor to Transistor Logic (TTL)

TTL is a type of digital circuit design that uses transistors as the main building blocks. The 74LS series, being TTL-based, employs bipolar transistors for its logic gates. The use of Schottky transistors within TTL helps reduce the stored charge and enhances switching speeds.

    Schottky Transistors for Faster Switching Speeds

Schottky transistors used in the 74LS series play a crucial role in improving the switching speed of the logic gates. The Schottky diodes associated with the transistors reduce the propagation delay, contributing to faster overall performance.

    Default Open Inputs to HIGH in TTL

In TTL logic, when an input is left unconnected (floating), it tends to default to a HIGH logic level. This is a characteristic behavior of TTL circuits, including the 74LS series. It simplifies the design by providing a default state when an input is not actively driven to a specific logic level.

    Legacy and Common Use

The 74LS series has been widely used in the past and has become somewhat of a legacy technology. While newer technologies like CMOS (e.g., 74HC) offer advantages in terms of power efficiency and noise immunity, the 74LS series is still relevant in certain applications, and many existing systems may still rely on it.


74HC Series

74HC series is characterized by its FET-based CMOS technology, operating on a wide voltage range, fast switching speeds, low power consumption, and improved noise margins. It is a versatile and modern choice for digital logic applications, offering several advantages over older technologies like TTL.

    FET-Based (CMOS Technology)

The 74HC series is FET-based, utilizing CMOS (Complementary Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) technology. CMOS technology combines both NMOS (n-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) and PMOS (p-type Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor) transistors, providing advantages in terms of power consumption and noise immunity.

    Operates on 2â€“6 Volts

The 74HC series is designed to operate within a voltage range of 2 to 6 volts. This flexibility in voltage levels allows for compatibility with a variety of systems and makes it suitable for applications with different power supply requirements.

    15nS Switching Speed

Similar to the 74LS series, the 74HC series is known for its relatively fast switching speeds, typically around 15 nanoseconds (15nS). This speed is crucial for applications where rapid signal processing and low propagation delay are essential.

    4mA Sink Capacity

The 74HC series has a sink capacity of 4mA. This indicates the maximum current the output can sink without experiencing a significant voltage drop. While not as high as the sink capacity of the 74LS series, it is sufficient for many digital applications.

    Uses MOSFET Technology for Better Power Consumption

MOSFETs (Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistors) are used in the 74HC series, contributing to its low power consumption. CMOS technology inherently consumes less power compared to bipolar-transistor-based technologies like TTL (used in the 74LS series).

    Wider Voltage Compatibility

The 74HC series can operate with a wider variety of voltages compared to TTL. This feature enhances its versatility and makes it suitable for interfacing with different types of devices and systems.

    Better Noise Margins

CMOS technology provides better noise margins compared to TTL. This means that the 74HC series is more robust in noisy environments, making it suitable for applications where signal integrity is crucial.

    Improved Power Consumption Compared to TTL

One of the significant advantages of the 74HC series is its improved power consumption compared to TTL technologies like the 74LS series. This makes it more energy-efficient and well-suited for battery-powered devices and other applications where power efficiency is essential.

    Modern Replacement for Older Technologies

The 74HC series is often considered a modern and better replacement for older TTL technologies such as the 74LS series. It combines speed, versatility, and energy efficiency, making it a preferred choice for many digital applications.
