  A PIC based frequency counter kit - part 1:building and modifying
    Shows how to add the simple preamp im place of the xtal test section
    on the board.

    Includes info about programming an offset freq that is added/subtracted
    from the freq shown (to allow for using a variable freq oscillator
    front end on a receiver whose freq is being measured by this kit.
    Also includes a basic 'how it works' set of steps.
 There is source code on gitlab for the original freq ctr.

NOTE: the importance of the preamplifiers, which not only boosts the 
input level but also limits the input voltage to a safe level for the PIC).

The input level of any signal input to the PIC (microcontroller) may only 
range from 0 Volts (= ground) to the supply voltage, i.e. 5 Volts. 
But this is only true if the PIC is really supplied with 5 Volts 
(I don't know, I never bought any of these kits). 
If the supply voltage is only 3 or 4 Volts from a battery, 
but 5 Volts are fed to the PIC's counter input: ZAP! 
A body diode conducts, and if the current isn't limited, 
it causes a Latch-up, in other words: R.I.P. my dear little chip). 
Anything more negative than 0 Volt, and anything more positive than the 
PIC's supply voltage can instantly kill the chip!
Again, to clarify this: I (Wolfgang "Wolf" BÃ¼scher, amateur radio callsign 
DL4YHF) am not the kit maker or -seller, but the developer of the 
original circuit, and (more important for the entire project) 
the firmware that makes the PIC act as an auto-ranging frequency meter.
