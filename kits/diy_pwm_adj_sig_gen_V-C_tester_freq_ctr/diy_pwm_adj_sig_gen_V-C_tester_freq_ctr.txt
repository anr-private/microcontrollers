All in one Experiment DIY Kit 】The multifunctional soldering kit can measure voltage and current, temperature, logic level, circuit on-off, signal frequency and duty cycle, etc. It can also act as a PWM adjustable signal generator, and provide two power outputs, respectively 3.3V and 5V, to meet the needs of different application scenarios. Two LED screens display values at the same time, greatly increasing the convenience of measurement.

PWM Adjustable Function Generator Kit 】Frequency range: 1Hz-31.2KHz; Duty cycle 0-100. You can freely set the frequency and duty cycle of the signal to meet the needs of different application scenarios, which can provide signals for motor drivers, steering gear, LED drivers, microcontrollers and measuring instruments.

Voltage and Current Tester Kit 】Voltage measurement range: 0-30V; Current measurement range 0-2A. The electronic kit can accurately read the voltage value and current strength in the circuit to monitor the circuit status in real time and ensure safe operation.

Soldering Learning Project】: This soldering diy kit is designed to provide a practical learning experience that combines theory with practice. You will learn about electronics and apply the knowledge in real scenarios and improve the level of soldering skills. But please note, this is a DIY kit, not a finished product, it requires certain foundation of basic electronic theoretical knowledge and soldering and hands-on ability.

Installation Manual】: The package comes with a paper instruction manual. You can scan the QR code on the instruction manual and download the PDF installation document. Or you can download the User Manual on the Amazon page at Product Guides and Documents.
