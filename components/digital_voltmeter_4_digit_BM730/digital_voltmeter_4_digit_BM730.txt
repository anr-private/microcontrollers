The V/A/W values are displayed correctly.
The M key does not work correctly. It just beeps when pressed (as do the up/down arrows)
Pressing the M key is supposed to allow you to set limits on voltage and current; when the limits are exceeded, the unit is supposed to beep its buzzer.

Also tried to do a 'factory reset' using the R button - which appeared to work but keys still do not function correctly.

Left a 1-star review on banggood. No result so far.
